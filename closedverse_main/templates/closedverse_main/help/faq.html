        <p>Hey there! If you have any questions about Closedverse, this page aims to answer them.</p>
		
		<h2>Bruh what's this?</h2>
		<p>It's a remake of Closedverse by DaKux/SMF9, Pip and Robby. This time it's gonna last and be a good site.</p>
		
		<h2>Something's wrong (or I want to ask a question for this)</h2>
		<p>Well then, no worries, you can instantly make a bug report or a suggestion via the Feedback button in your User Menu (top right corner). Enjoy!</p>
		<h2>I did something, but it didn't actually do it.</h2>
		<p>If you perform an action (Yeah a post, edit a post, delete a post, follow/unfollow someone, change profile settings, etc..) but, even after refreshing, it appears that nothing has happened, then something has gone wrong.<br>
		This site does not return errors if there is an error (example, if you Yeah your own post on Miiverse, the server tells you that you cannot do that, however this one just tells you that it was successful), so if this happens, then something is wrong.<br>If you're either confused or sure this isn't a problem on your side, let me know and I'll look into it.</p>
		<h2>I did something, but then it suddenly reverted itself, I refreshed and it worked.</h2>
		<p>If you edit a post, set a post as a favorite, send a friend request, etc. and then it appears that didn't go through but refreshing the page makes the changes, this means that my database is slow.<br>I don't expect this to happen much, but at times, the database can pretend to be finished when it's not, your browser could refresh after an action, and the database still isn't done.<br>Again, this is only a problem I've been encountering on my development server, so I don't expect this to be a thing here.</p>
		<h2>Can I delete my account?</h2>
		<p>No. If you need to delete one by emergency though, contact me.<br>The reason is kinda simple: it's like a domino effect if I delete your account, if I delete your account, then your profile, posts, comments, messages, friendships, follows, etc. are deleted. Obviously, that should be so, but I don't have a "fake deletion" system like Miiverse does, if it's deleted, then it's GONE forever, bye-bye, see ya.<br>I might make it a thing in the future though.</p>
		<h2>I don't like my username, can you give me another one?</h2>
		<p>I can do that, but there's one catch: if you change your username, all of your content is still there, but the URL to your user page won't be the same. <br>So, I can do this, but not often. Just let me know what's up and I'll do it.</p>
		<h2>I'm not getting emails when resetting my password.</h2>
		<p>Sorry, I don't know what to do when that happens. Of course, you should check your spam folder, since I'm not using my own host and am using PF2M's because his is easier to manage.<br>Again, contact me/us.</p>
		<h2>Are there any limits? Post limit, comment limit, friend limit, follow limit..</h2>
		<p>The only limit that's here is a posting time limit, and it's the same as Miiverse's, its only purpose is to prevent spam. Other than that, there isn't a limit on friends you can have, and there isn't a limit on how many people you can follow.. yet. Keep in mind: limits are not just simply set, they have to actually be implemented. If there can be an amount of something, it probably isn't limited.</p>
		<h2>How do I set a custom avatar?</h2>
		<p>To do that, you need a Gravatar account. Gravatar lets sites automatically get an avatar from an e-mail address registered on Gravatar.<br>So, first, register for Gravatar on <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">their site</a>. Yes, you need a WordPress account, but you might find more sites that use Gravatar.<br>After you have that set up, your avatar won't instantly update, you have to go into <a href="{% url "main:profile-settings" %}">Profile Settings</a> and select (or re-select) your avatar as a Gravatar, then actually that's it.<br>GIFs may or may not work. I'm not sure. I don't like them anyway, so yeah.</p>
		<h2>How do I disable yeah notifs?</h2>
		<p>Go into your Account Settings in your user menu (the menu icon thing) and do it there. That simple.</p>
		
		<h2>Less question-y questions</h2>
		<h3>Ew, why are you using reCAPTCHA?</h3>
		<p>We have reCAPTCHA? Nah we don't.</p>
		<h3>What's with the Splatoon loading animation? It looks stupid.</h3>
		<p>It's good shut up.</p>
        <h3>Haha, now where's my Markdown?</h3>
		<p>Sorry, but I just haven't been able to make it happen. Discord's Markdown is really just fake Markdown, as it has lots more to it: headings, images, links, paragraphs, you get the idea. All of the implementations of Markdown in Python have either all of that or nothing.<br>There is really Markdown, but it's in Messages, which is why one line break now looks like a space in messages.<br>Again, sorry. If anyone could find a good enough text formatting implementation that works in Django, let me know.</p>
		<h3>The color looks ugly.</h3>
		<p>Sorry, but the dark black theme was too dark.</p>
		<h3>This logo looks ugly.</h3>
		<p>If you can make a better one, do it.</p>
		<h3>Closedverse? What?</h3>
        <p>Yes, that's the official name we're using.</p>

        <h3>What's wrong with the other active Miiverse Clones?</h3>
		<p>There are a few active clones out now with their own things. It just depends with one you like the most. Here's a list of all the active clones as of right now (as I'm typing). I will try to list them with as little bias as possible.</p>
		<p>
		<strong>Uiiverse</strong><br>
		<ul>
		<li>So Uiiverse was pretty much the first popular, major clone after the main Miiverse Clone Trinity died.</li>
		<li>It's main goal is to be as much like Miiverse as possible but it does have some new features like lots of good theme options, custom pfp's, and image posting. So in other words, it's pretty much a Miiverse Emulator type clone.</li>
		<li>It is a decent clone though with staff that gives a crap about the site and it's well being.</li>
		<li>The main drawback of Uiiverse though, is as I said above, it's mainly a Miiverse Emulation type clone and the main thing with that is it has Miivers style rules that is meant for a younger userbase.</li>
		<li>There's really nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't really appeal to alot of veteran clone users. Overall it is a decent clone and I reccomend you check it out. https://uiiverse.xyz</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>rverse</strong><br>
		<ul>
		<li>So rverse classifies as two things. A Miiverse Clone and a Miiverse replacement.</li>
		<li>Rverse is pretty much a homebrew backup server of Miiverse (a patch) for 3DS and Wii U. It's alright for the most part.</li>
		<li>It has the features original Miiverse did like drawing and stuff, but alot of things are broken on it like notifs.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<strong>Closedverse-PHP</strong><br>
		<ul>
		<li>Basically what it sounds like. It's an attempt to make a decent alternative to the original Closedverse code made by me. It's a WIP and things still need to be added/fixed. Right now, the only big feature it has is Uiiverse's theme options (credit to Robby for helping with that :D) I guess it technically doesn't count as an active clone since it's not even officially hosted right now but you're free to host it if you want. https://github.com/That64Boi/Closedverse-PHP</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

        <h3>What are the advantages of this one?</h3>
        <p>I'll list what deviates this from the other Miiverse clones.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>I think this is the only Miiverse clone not written in PHP. This is written in Python and uses the Django framework, and Django is a framework for crazy fast development with the best programming.</li>
		<li>There are pretty much no worries about bad programming. Closedverse doesn't have much of the naive programming practices other naive PHP clones have, and it also works completely around much of average security worries (SQL injection; we have not written any SQL, XSS; we are automatically escaping and templating, CSRF; it's handled automatically in Django)</li>
		<li>Why would you care? Well, this is now easy to develop for, I can add features quickly and nicely. It's also secure, there isn't any chance someone can put something into a box and control the database (SQL injections)</li>
		<li>Yes, this doesn't have many features at the moment, but I'm working to <i>really</i> deviate from Miiverse, such as supporting Markdown and having friends, but also improving upon most of what PF2M had originally intended to do but couldn't.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse">This is an open-source project!</a> Anyone can view the code that runs this very site and make improvements if they wanted to. I don't have anything to hide.</li>
		</ul>
